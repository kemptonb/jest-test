# jest-test

I created a series of tests using Jest and exported/imported JS functions.

Tests include: 

1. A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

2. A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

3. A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

4. A caesarCipher function that takes a string and returns it with each character “shifted”. Read more about how a Caesar cipher works on this website: http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/.

A. Tests wrapping from z to a
B. Tests case
C. Tests punctuation

5. analyzeArray function that takes an array and returns and object of min, max, avg, and length.
